# Line Encoding

Welcome to the Line Encoding project! This project is focused on implementing and analyzing various line encoding schemes used in digital communication systems.

## Project Overview

Line encoding is a method used to convert digital data into a digital signal. This project explores different line encoding techniques, providing implementations and analyses of their performance and characteristics.

## Features

- Implementation of various line encoding schemes:
  - Unipolar NRZ (Non-Return to Zero)
  - Polar NRZ
  - Bipolar NRZ
  - Manchester Encoding
  - Differential Manchester Encoding
- Analysis of encoding schemes in terms of:
  - Signal efficiency
  - Error detection capabilities
  - Bandwidth requirements
- Visualization of encoded signals to facilitate understanding of each encoding technique

## Technologies Used

- C++

## How It Works

1. **Implementation**: The project includes Python scripts to implement various line encoding schemes.
2. **Analysis**: Each encoding scheme is analyzed for its efficiency, error detection capabilities, and bandwidth requirements.
3. **Visualization**: Encoded signals are visualized using Matplotlib to help users understand the differences and characteristics of each encoding technique.
